# üåç Project Neodrive

### A radical redisign of urban mobility

Project **Neodrive** is an open, collaborative effort to design a new class of ultra-efficient, human-centered vehicles for urban travel. vehicles that are **as easy to use as a bike**, **as comfortable as a small car**, and **10‚Äì50√ó more energy-efficient**.

We aim to build vehicles that make switching away from cars not a sacrifice, but an upgrade : cleaner, lighter, cheaper, and more joyful.

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What We‚Äôre Building

Neodrive is not just one vehicle, it‚Äôs a research **platform**.
Our first prototype is a **light electric vehicle (LEV)** under 50 kg, classified legally as a *bike*.

* **Pedal-by-wire**: The pedals don‚Äôt drive the wheels mechanically ‚Äî they measure input effort, and the motor compensates for system losses to provide a ‚Äúsuperhuman‚Äù but still bike-like experience.
* **Efficient**: Target energy use is less than 10 Wh/km (‚âà 150 km range on a 1 kWh battery).
* **Comfortable and practical**: Weather protection, upright seating, space for a passenger or cargo.
* **Sustainable materials**: Recyclable PET sheets, aluminum/steel, and wood with the goal of being easily repairable.
* **Accessible**: Designed to be affordable, open-source, and modular.

The project‚Äôs end goal is not just a product it's an experiment to see how to design and think tommorow's vehicle.

## üå± Why We‚Äôre Doing It

Transportation is one of the biggest contributors to climate change, congestion, and wasted energy.
Cars are overbuilt for most daily trips ‚Äî often carrying a single person and hundreds of kilograms of steel through short city journeys.

We believe that:

* **The future of cities is lighter, quieter and smarter.**
* **Every person should be able to move efficiently, safely, and comfortably without a car.**
* **Open, interdisciplinary design accelerates innovation**  engineers, designers, urbanists, and makers can co-create the next generation of vehicles.

Neodrive exists to **prove that sustainable transport can be elegant, exciting, and practical** and to share everything we learn.

## üß† Guiding Principles

1. **Open Source Everything** Transparency accelerates progress.
2. **Design for Humans, Not Machines** Comfort, safety, and joy first.
3. **Sufficiency Over Excess** Minimal energy, maximal utility.
4. **Repair, Reuse, Reimagine** Low tech materials and modular design.
5. **Build, Test, Iterate** Science, not slogans.
